Create a new ERC-20 token named TIGERAI. This token should have a whitelist that allows ONLY the people on the whitelist to perform certain functions. Add four functions with the following specifications:
mint(uint256, address) should allow ONLY the whitelisted people to mint new tokens. Given an input of a specified amount of new tokens and a specified wallet address, it should mint and subsequently deposit that amount of tokens in the wallet.
burn(uint256) should burnthe specified amount of tokens from the sender.
addTowhitelist(address) should allow ONLY the owner of the contract to add a specified address to the whitelist.
removeFromWhitelist(address) should allow ONLY the owner of the contract to remove a specified address from the whitelist, if it exists.

Here is the code skeleton that you should fill in:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TIGERAI is ERC20 {

   constructor() ERC20("TIGERAI", "TAI") {

   }

   function mint(uint256 amount, address wallet) public {

   }

   function burn(uint256 amount) public {

   }

   function addToWhitelist(address _address) public onlyOwner {

   }

   function removeFromWhitelist(address _address) public onlyOwner {

   }
}
